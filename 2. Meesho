## Round 1:

1. Formal introduction
2. A team organizing a university career fair has a list of companies along with their respective arrival times and their duration of stay. Only one company can present at any time. Given each companyâ€™s arrival time and the duration they will stay, determine the maximum number of presentations that can be hosted during the career fair.

Sample example:
N = 5 (number of companies)
Arrival = {1, 3, 3, 5, 7}
Durations = {2, 3, 1, 2, 1}
