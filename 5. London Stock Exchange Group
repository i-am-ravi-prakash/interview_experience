3. You are given a string S containing name of employees of a company comma and space seperated and one string C which is the company name. Generate unique email ids for all employees which follow below rules:

- Only first and last name to be considered. Ignore middle name if present for any employees.
- If there are two or more than two employees with same name then add counter just after the name in email address. See the below example:
  Let say there are three persons with same name Ravi Prakash. So their email ids will be like below:
  ravi.prakash@company.com, ravi.prakash2@company.com, ravi.prakash3@company.com
- email id will be in all small letters


Sample test case:
S = "Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Surya Kumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya"
C = BCCI

O/P: rohit.sharma@bcci.com, virat.kohli@bcci.com, surya.yadav@bcci.com, rishabh.pant@bcci.com, hardik.pandya@bcci.com
