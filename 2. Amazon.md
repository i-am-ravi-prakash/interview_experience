1. To increase efficiency, the Amazon shipping team packages being shipped according to weight. They will merge lighter package with heavier package which will eliminate the need for separate shipment.

packageWeight[i] represents weight of ith package. You can combine ith package and (i+1)th package if packageWeight[i] < packageWeight[i+1] then discard the ith package. After this operation the number of packages is reduced by 1 and weight of (i+1)th package increases by packageWeight[i].

Find the maximum possible weight of a package that can be achieved after any sequence of merge operations.
